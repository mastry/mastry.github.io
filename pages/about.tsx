            <p>
                I&apos;m a long-time computer professional. I&apos;ve been a
                programmer, a systems engineer, a performance engineer, an IT
                director, and an architect but mostly I like to write code and
                design large-scale systems.

            <p>
                (I&apos;ve also been a beach monkey, a cashier, a pool boy, a
                locksmith, and a soldier but I don&apos;t think you&apos;re here
                for the stories of my youth. Trust me, you&apos;re not...
                although I do have a few good stories I might spill over a free
                beer or two.)
