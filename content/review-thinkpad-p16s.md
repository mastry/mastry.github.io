Back in June 2022 I purchased a [Lenovo P16s](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=lenovo+p16s+site%3Alenovo.com&t=ffab&ia=web) to replace my aging development laptop (a ThinkPad P1 G3). I've been using the P16s for about half a year now, so I thought I'd share my impressions.

> **TLDR:** I don't recommend this laptop. It's too bulky for an 'S' series workstation, has an inferior keyboard compared to previous generations, and offers no performance improvement over (recent) earlier models.

## Specs

-   12th Generation Intel® Core™ i7-1260P Processor (E-Core Max 3.40 GHz, P-Core Max 4.70 GHz with Turbo Boost, 12 Cores, 16 Threads, 18 MB Cache)
-   16.0" WQXGA (2560 x 1600) IPS, anti-glare with Dolby Vision™, 400 nits, low blue-light
-   NVIDIA® T550 4GB GDDR6
-   1 TB SSD M.2 2280 PCIe Gen4 Performance TLC Opal
-   32 GB DDR4 3200MHz (16GB soldered)
-   Windows 11 Pro

With taxes and shipping I paid approximately $2,200.

## Performance and Battery Life

With Lenovo's adoption of Intel's new [efficiency cores](https://www.pcmag.com/news/intels-alder-lake-combines-performance-and-efficiency-cpu-cores-on-one), I wasn't expecting a huge performance boost over my P1. I wasn't disappointed - performance is indiscernible from my old P1 in day-to-day development work.

That would be a good thing if it resulted in significantly better battery life (one of the supposed benefits of the "e-cores"). Unfortunately, that's not the case. Battery life _is_ a little better, but not by much. I get about 4.5 hours of battery life with the screen at 80% brightness, compared to about 4 hours with my P1. Given that Apple's M1 MacBook Pro [can chug along for _15+ hours (!)_](https://www.tomsguide.com/news/macbook-pro-2021-battery-life-tested-heres-how-they-stack-up), this is a **major** disappointment. Intel, Microsoft, and the PC makers need to wake up.

## Keyboard & Trackpad

Traditionally, the ThinkPad keyboard has always been one of its strongest features. Not anymore - the P16s keyboard is a downgrade from every other ThinkPad keyboard I have used. Key travel is significantly shorter than I like and the keys are so low to the chassis that (even after 6 months of use) my typing error rate has increased to frustrating levels. There _is_ a virtually silent click at the start of key travel, but the overall feel is still cheap, and I think most developers will be turned off by it. I'm certainly not a fan.

The trackpad is fine. Which is saying a lot for a Windows-based laptop. It's not as good as the trackpad on a MacBook Pro, but it's not bad at all. I just wish it wasn't offset to the left.

## Display

The new 16:10 aspect ratio is a welcome change. I've been using 16:9 displays for years, and I'm glad to have a little more vertical space for writing code. I'll never buy another 16:9 laptop.

The 2560 x 1600 matte display is bright (often too bright) and has good color reproduction. Certainly more than good enough for software development.

## Conclusion

Skip it. There's just not enough here to justify the price, and the keyboard is a deal-breaker if you're a developer or a writer.
